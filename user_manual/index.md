=== 1. Introduction

This operating system exists as a project for comp3300, an operating systems 
class run at the Australian National University. It is designed for the Meggy
Jnr RGB, a small embeded circurt board with an AVR microcontroller and looks
like a Gameboy. 

As part of learning how an operating system is implemented, we have to construct
a simple OS that allows a programmer to easily create a simple game by providing
simple interfaces to the underlying hardware and to constructs suitable to game
developement. 

A major component to the assignment was the creation of system for threading. 
This should allow the game. 

==== About the Meggy Jnr RGB

The Meggy Jnr RGB is a device created by Evil Mad Scientists for beginners to 
the embedded projects arena. It comes in a kit form where the user must build it
before it can be used. It comes preloaded with a simple game but it can be 
overriden with other users games or completely reprogramed in C/C++

==== About Comp3300

Simply a course run by the ANU for software engineering students to gain an 
understanding about operating systems.

==== About Me

I'm Sam, A software engineering student at the Australian Nation University 
who is keenly interested in everything computers. This is my first embedded 
project have thoroughly enjoyed it. I also program for the web and you can
