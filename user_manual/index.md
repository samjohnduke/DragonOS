=== 1. Introduction

This operating system exists as a project for comp3300, an operating systems 
class run at the Australian National University. It is designed for the Meggy
Jnr RGB, a small embeded circurt board with an AVR microcontroller and looks
like a Gameboy. 

As part of learning how an operating system is implemented, we have to construct
a simple OS that allows a programmer to easily create a simple game by providing
simple interfaces to the underlying hardware and to constructs suitable to game
developement. 

A major component to the assignment was the creation of system for threading. 
This should allow the game. 

==== About the Meggy Jnr RGB

The Meggy Jnr RGB is a device created by Evil Mad Scientists for beginners to 
the embedded projects arena. It comes in a kit form where the user must build it
before it can be used. It comes preloaded with a simple game but it can be 
overriden with other users games or completely reprogramed in C/C++

==== About Comp3300

Simply a course run by the ANU for software engineering students to gain an 
understanding about operating systems.

==== About Me

I'm Sam, A software engineering student at the Australian Nation University 
who is keenly interested in everything computers. This is my first embedded 
project have thoroughly enjoyed it. I also program for the web and you can 
find my in development website at samjohnduke.com


=== 2. How to Use the User Manual

==== Function Reference

Every .c .h combination file has a corisponding markdown file in the user manual
folder documentation. For now this is just hand written but I would prefer to 
build this from doxygen later on. 

Each function reference is designed to provide a simple interface to understand 
what all the components do at a low level. 

==== Tutorials

Rather than just describing how all the components fit together, the tutorials 
folder contains a number of short tutorials on how to use the operating system
to do specific tasks. There are a number of main tutorials limited only by time.

The tutorials include:

1. Flashing Aux lights
2. Rainbow Screen
3. Button Bombs

More will be added when I have the time. 

==== Example Games

For the assignment, I have to create a game. To do this i thought i would 
actually record the development process so that it is useful for other 
developers and users creating games on the operating system.
