Eventually however, I would love to see it become a possible option for building simple AVR applications \r\nacross many differing devices and peripherals.\r\n\r\n#### What is the Meggy Jnr RGB\r\n\r\nIt's this thing that you can buy and then build and hopefully play and if your really clever (or required to by your lecturer) program it. You can find heaps more about it at [EvilMadScientists](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/meggy-jr-rgb/).\r\n\r\n#### Quick Notes\r\n\r\nThe Developers name (that's me) is Sam and he is a software engineering student at the Australian National University. Interestingly he has never actually done an embedded type project before and greatly enjoyed  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Building the OS\r\n\r\nAt the moment it isn't working, but eventually (I'll update you on when) the following commands will be used to first build and then push the code onto the Meggy. \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake\r\nmake push\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now the OS is on the Meggy you can get to work and either play the built in game or start to build your own.\r\n\r\n#### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is by @strik3r2 (Sam) and he says you can do what you like with it as long as you buy him a beer some time.\r\n\r\n#### Support or Contact\r\nLog an issue OR send a pull request OR send an email to mail@samjohnduke.com"}
